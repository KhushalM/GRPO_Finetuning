Speed is a scalar quantity—it only has magnitude—while velocity is a vector, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. For example, if you drive around a circle at a constant speed, your velocity is constantly changing because your direction changes. Does this help clarify how velocity gives more information than speed?"

This is because context in language often depends on nuances, prior knowledge, and subtle relationships that require a form of reasoning and world knowledge beyond pattern recognition. For example, the sentence \"I saw her duck\" could mean seeing a person’s pet or witnessing someone quickly lowering their head—context is key. Neural networks improve by using architectures like transformers and attention mechanisms that help them weigh relevant parts of the input, but they still can struggle with deeper understanding or ambiguity. Does this help clarify why context remains a challenge for AI language models?"
